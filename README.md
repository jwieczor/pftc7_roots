# PFTC7 South Africa root trait, root biomass and soil data

This GitHub repository contains the code to download, clean, summarise, analyse and visualise the respective belowground trait and soil datasets.

The raw data can be downloaded from the [Open Science Framework platform](https://osf.io/hk2cy/), either directly or using the provided scripts.

This repo contains the raw and clean data, and R scripts to clean the data for three datasets: a) root (and leaf) traits, b) root biomass mapping using a ground penetrating radar (GPR), and c) soil texture and nutrient analysis.

## Folder structure

Each dataset has it's own raw and clean data folder corresponding to its number (v, vi, xii). The R scripts are stored in the `scripts/` folder, while the exploratory results for each dataset are in the `results/` folder.

## Data dictionaries

Each of the clean datasets has a corresponding data dictionary to provide information about each variable, including: description, variable type, the range or levels and how it was measured.
