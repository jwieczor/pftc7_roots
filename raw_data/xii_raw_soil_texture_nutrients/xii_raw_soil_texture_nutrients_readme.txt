This is the readme file for the xii_raw_soil_texture_nutrients dataset.
This file describes the soil texture and nutrient measurements and classifications from the plots along the elevational gradient. See the associated data paper for more details on the methods.

This file contains the raw soil texture and nutrient measurements and classifications.

Variables:
BlockNo is a unique ID for each sample, representing the naming structure "site_aspect_plot unique_ID"
LabNO is the given unique laboratory ID for each sample
Depth_cm is the depth band where the soil sample was collected measured in cm
Total_P is the total phosphorous measured in mg/kg
pH is the measure of how acidic or basic the sample is. This measure is on a scale of 0-14.
Stone is the proportional amount of stone mass in the sample measured as a % 
C is the total organic carbon measured as a % 
TN is the total nitrogen measured as a %
CEC is the cation exchange capacity measured in cmol/kg
Clay is the proportional amount of clay mass in the sample measured as a %
Silt is the proportional amount of silt mass in the sample measured as a %
Sand is the proportional amount of sand mass in the sample measured as a %
Classification is the derived soil texture classification when accounting for the proportion of clay, silt and sand in the sample
